## Projects

### 1. Music Dataset Preprocessing
- **Problem Statement:**  
  Raw music datasets often contain missing values and inconsistent formats, making them unsuitable for analysis. The challenge was to clean and prepare the dataset for further exploration.  
- **Solution Approach:**  
  - Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset.  
  - Handled missing values and transformed data.  
  - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and distributions.  
- **Tools / Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- **Key Highlights:**  
  - Practiced data cleaning, handling missing values, and performing EDA.  
  - Strengthened foundational skills in dataset preprocessing.

### 2. Car vs. Bike Classification
- **Problem Statement:**  
  Classifying images into categories (cars or bikes) using machine learning. Goal: build a model to distinguish between car and bike images automatically.  
- **Solution Approach:**  
  - Collected and prepared an image dataset of cars and bikes.  
  - Preprocessed images: resizing, normalization, and feature extraction.  
  - Built a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier and tuned hyperparameters.  
  - Evaluated performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.  
- **Tools / Stack:** Python, scikit-learn, OpenCV, NumPy  
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- **Key Highlights:**  
  - Practiced classical ML for image classification.  
  - Learned hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation techniques.

### 3. Health Diagnosis Model
- **Problem Statement:**  
  Using patient symptom data to predict potential diseases and provide improvement suggestions.  
- **Solution Approach:**  
  - Collected and cleaned a dataset of patient symptoms and diseases.  
  - Implemented a multi-model approach for symptom-to-disease mapping.  
  - Generated reports suggesting improvements or potential health risks.  
  - Evaluated model accuracy using classification metrics.  
- **Tools / Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
