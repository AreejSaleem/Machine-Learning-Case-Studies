This repository contains my machine learning projects, where I explore various ML algorithms and techniques. Each project demonstrates my ability to work with different datasets, apply model-building processes, and implement solutions to real-world problems. It includes hands-on projects focused on predictive modeling, classification, regression, and more

# MachineLearning
#-1.Music Dataset Preprocessing:

Cleaned and preprocessed a large music dataset.
Handled missing values, transformed data, and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).

#-2.Car vs. Bike Classification:

Classified images of cars and bikes using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
Implemented KNN, tuned hyperparameters, and evaluated performance.

#-3.Healthstream General health checkup model in python

Used multimodel approach to train the data on symptoms of general diseases
Mapped symptoms to diseases and generated a suggestion/improvement report
